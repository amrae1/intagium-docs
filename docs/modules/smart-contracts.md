# Smart Contracts (CosmWasm)

INTAGIUM includes comprehensive support for smart contracts through the CosmWasm runtime, providing a secure, efficient, and developer-friendly platform for building decentralized applications.

## Overview

CosmWasm enables developers to write smart contracts in Rust that can interact with INTAGIUM's custom modules and the broader Cosmos ecosystem.

## Key Features

**Rust-Based Development**: Smart contracts are written in Rust, a modern systems programming language that provides memory safety, performance, and excellent tooling support. Rust's strong type system and ownership model help prevent common smart contract vulnerabilities.

**WebAssembly Execution**: Contracts are compiled to WebAssembly and executed in a sandboxed environment that provides deterministic execution and efficient resource utilization. This approach ensures that contracts behave consistently across different nodes and execution environments.

**Module Integration**: Smart contracts can interact with INTAGIUM's custom modules, enabling developers to build applications that leverage digital rights management, asset ownership tracking, secure data delivery, and infrastructure coordination capabilities.

**Enhanced Security**: CosmWasm provides several security enhancements over traditional smart contract platforms, including gas metering, deterministic execution, and sandboxed environments that prevent contracts from interfering with each other or the underlying system.

## Getting Started

To develop smart contracts:

1. **[Set up your development environment](/getting-started/quick-start)**
2. **[Get test tokens from the faucet](/getting-started/faucet-usage)**
3. **[Try the Hello World tutorial](/getting-started/hello-world)**
