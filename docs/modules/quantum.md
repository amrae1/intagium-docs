# Quantum Module (Placeholder)

The Quantum module represents INTAGIUM's forward-thinking approach to blockchain security, providing a framework for implementing post-quantum cryptographic algorithms when they become necessary.

## Overview

This module is currently inactive but provides a foundation for future quantum-resistant security implementations.


- **[Quantum Flow Digramm](/flowdigramm/quantum-flow)** - Quantum Flow Digramm 

## Current Status

⚠️ **Inactive Placeholder** - This module will be activated through governance when quantum computing threats become imminent.

## Future Capabilities

- Post-quantum cryptographic algorithms
- Quantum-resistant key management
- Future-proof security framework
- Migration tools and utilities

## Activation

The Quantum module will be activated through community governance when quantum computing advances pose a threat to current cryptographic systems.
