# EDM (Enhanced Data Management) Module

The Enhanced Data Management (EDM) module represents INTAGIUM's sophisticated approach to secure data storage, delivery, and access control in a decentralized environment. The EDM module addresses the critical challenges of data privacy, security, and controlled access that are essential for enterprise applications, sensitive communications, and compliance with data protection regulations.

## Overview

Traditional data management systems often struggle with balancing accessibility and security, particularly in distributed environments where data needs to be shared across multiple parties while maintaining strict access controls. The EDM module solves these challenges by providing a blockchain-based data management layer that combines cryptographic security, granular access controls, and transparent audit trails with the flexibility and scalability needed for modern applications.

The EDM module is designed to handle various types of data including documents, media files, structured datasets, encrypted communications, and any other digital information that requires secure storage and controlled access. The system uses advanced encryption techniques to ensure data confidentiality while providing efficient mechanisms for authorized access and sharing.

One of the key innovations of the EDM module is its ability to separate data storage from access control, enabling organizations to maintain control over their data while leveraging distributed storage solutions. This approach provides the benefits of decentralization while ensuring that sensitive data remains protected and accessible only to authorized parties.

## Key Features

### Secure Data Storage and Encryption
The EDM module provides enterprise-grade data encryption and storage capabilities that ensure data confidentiality and integrity. The system supports multiple encryption algorithms and key management strategies, allowing organizations to choose the security level that best meets their needs and compliance requirements.

### Granular Access Control
The module implements sophisticated access control mechanisms that enable fine-grained permissions management. Data owners can specify exactly who can access their data, under what conditions, and for how long. These permissions are enforced automatically by the blockchain, ensuring consistent and reliable access control across all interactions.

### Version Control and Data Lineage
The EDM module provides comprehensive version control capabilities that track all changes to data over time. This functionality is essential for collaborative environments, compliance requirements, and maintaining data integrity in complex workflows where multiple parties may need to access and modify data.

### Secure Data Delivery
The module includes secure delivery mechanisms that ensure data reaches intended recipients without interception or tampering. The delivery system supports various protocols and can adapt to different network conditions and security requirements.

### Analytics and Reporting
The EDM module provides powerful analytics capabilities that enable organizations to gain insights from their data while maintaining privacy and security. The analytics system can process encrypted data and provide aggregated results without exposing sensitive information.

### Compliance and Audit Support
The module is designed to support various compliance frameworks and regulatory requirements. All data access and modification activities are logged on the blockchain, creating an immutable audit trail that can be used for compliance reporting and forensic analysis.

## Message Types

### MsgCreateDataset
Enables users to create new datasets in the EDM system.

```go
type MsgCreateDataset struct {
    Creator     string `json:"creator"`
    Name        string `json:"name"`
    Description string `json:"description"`
    DataType    string `json:"data_type"`
    EncryptionType string `json:"encryption_type"`
    AccessRules []AccessRule `json:"access_rules"`
    Metadata    map[string]string `json:"metadata"`
    Size        int64 `json:"size"`
}
```

### MsgGrantAccess
Allows data owners to grant access permissions to other users or applications.

```go
type MsgGrantAccess struct {
    DatasetId   string `json:"dataset_id"`
    Grantor     string `json:"grantor"`
    Grantee     string `json:"grantee"`
    Permissions []Permission `json:"permissions"`
    Duration    int64 `json:"duration"`
    Conditions  []AccessCondition `json:"conditions"`
}
```

### MsgRevokeAccess
Enables data owners to revoke previously granted access permissions.

### MsgUpdateDataset
Allows authorized users to update dataset content, metadata, or access rules.

### MsgRequestAccess
Enables users to request access to datasets that they do not currently have permission to access.

### MsgProcessAnalytics
Initiates analytics operations on datasets, enabling users to perform computations and generate insights while maintaining data privacy and security.
