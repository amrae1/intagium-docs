# Governance Module

The Governance module provides INTAGIUM's decentralized decision-making framework, enabling community-driven evolution of the platform through transparent voting mechanisms.

## Overview

## Key Features

**Community-Driven Decision Making**: The governance system enables any INTAG token holder to submit proposals and participate in voting, ensuring that the network's evolution is driven by community consensus rather than centralized authority.

**Token-Weighted Voting**: Voting power is proportional to the amount of INTAG tokens staked by participants, aligning governance influence with network investment and ensuring that decisions are made by those with the greatest stake in the network's success.

**Flexible Proposal Types**: The system supports various proposal types to accommodate different governance needs, from simple community signaling to complex protocol upgrades and module activations.

**Transparent Process**: All governance activities are recorded on the blockchain, providing complete transparency into the decision-making process and enabling community members to track proposal progress and voting patterns.

**Automatic Execution**: Approved proposals are automatically executed by the blockchain, ensuring that governance decisions are implemented promptly and accurately without requiring manual intervention.
