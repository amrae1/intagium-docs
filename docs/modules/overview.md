### Modular Design Principles

**Interoperability**: Each module is designed to work seamlessly with other modules and the core Cosmos SDK functionality. Modules can share data and trigger actions across the ecosystem.

**Governance Control**: Modules can be activated, deactivated, or modified through INTAGIUM's governance system, ensuring that the platform can evolve based on community needs.

**Extensibility**: The modular architecture allows for new modules to be added without disrupting existing functionality, enabling continuous innovation and adaptation.

**Standards Compliance**: All modules follow consistent design patterns and API standards, making integration and development predictable and efficient.

### Common Module Features

All INTAGIUM modules share certain common characteristics:

**Message Types**: Each module defines specific message types that enable users to interact with module functionality through transactions.

**Query Types**: Comprehensive query capabilities allow users to retrieve information and monitor module state.

**Keeper Functions**: Core business logic is implemented in keeper functions that handle validation, state changes, and cross-module interactions.

**CLI Commands**: Command-line interfaces provide direct access to module functionality for developers and power users.

**REST APIs**: RESTful APIs enable integration with web applications and external systems.

**Genesis Configuration**: Configurable parameters allow customization of module behavior and operational limits.

## Integration Patterns

### Cross-Module Interactions

INTAGIUM's modules are designed to work together, creating powerful combinations of functionality:

**DRM + DOR Integration**: Content registered in the DRM module can be tokenized as assets in the DOR module, enabling complex licensing and ownership arrangements.

**EDM + DRM Integration**: The EDM module can provide secure storage and delivery for DRM-protected content, ensuring that licensing terms are enforced at the data level.

**Infra + All Modules**: The Infrastructure module can coordinate resources needed by other modules, such as storage nodes for EDM or distribution networks for DRM.

### External System Integration

Each module provides comprehensive APIs for integration with external systems:

**REST APIs**: Standard HTTP APIs for web application integration
**gRPC APIs**: High-performance APIs for system-to-system communication
**WebSocket APIs**: Real-time APIs for live updates and notifications
